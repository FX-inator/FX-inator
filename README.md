- 👋 Hi, I’m @FX-inator!
- 👀 I’m interested in UI/UX, product management, AR, biomedical nanotechnology, improving education through gamification, and more efficient systems of sustainable energy (such as through interactions with Earth's magnetic fields and electromagnetic induction).
- 🌱 I’m currently developing an eduTech venture, competing in various international competitions, and finding a profession in the fields of technology and business. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to start my own startups, potentially working at a big Tech company for awhile, and collaborate with others on innovative projects!
